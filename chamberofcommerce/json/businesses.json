          "summary": "Pets Plus Natural has built our business based on the fact that what your pet eats affects its health. We offer the area&rsquo;s largest selection of natural and holistic pet foods at the lowest prices. And as more of us become concerned about where and how our food is processed, we are proud to say we have the biggest variety of American-made pet foods and treats in the region. We are local and family-owned and have been serving Philadelphia area pet families since 1988. Now, in partnership with the Humane Society of the United States and numerous shelters, we have become a rescue center offering dogs, cats, puppies and kittens for adoption. Saving animals from cruelty, neglect and homelessness one new family at a time has become our key mission. Our commitment makes it possible for our partners to save more animals in need, even before a forever family steps forward. &nbsp;Adopt one, save two is how we think of this new model for rescue since every pet available for adoption has already escaped a desperate situation. These pets are vet-checked, vaccinated, and spayed or neutered.",
